# winequalityproject
In this project, I will investigate the real-world datasets of the red and white vinho verde wine samples from the north of Portugal.
The aims of this project were:
1) to practice my data analysis skills using Python
2) to find the useful insights of the datasets in order to answer these following questions:
    
    #Q1: What chemical characteristic (volatile acidity, residual sugar, pH, alcohol) is most likely to have a positive impact on the wine quality?
    
    #Q2: Is a certain type of wine (red/white) associated with higher quality?
    
    #Q3: What level of acidity (pH values) receives the highest average rating?
    
    #Q4: Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?
    
    #Q5: Do sweeter wines (more residual sugar) receive better ratings?

The datasets for red and white wine used in this project can be found via this link:
